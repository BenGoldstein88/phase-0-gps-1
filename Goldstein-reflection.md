- I was struggling somewhat with moving swiftly through branching/merging/pushing in the terminal prior to the session, but with every pass it gets a little easier.


- version control, terminal interface, some new git commands, and the inherent details were clarified in aprt during the GPS

- we asked questions about feasibility and syntax. Like if it's possible to change a commit message (it is with --amend)

- git doesn't confuse me at the moment, but that's just because i'm not doing anything new with it yet. I'm sure it will present new and interesting problems in the future

- First pairing in general as well as first GPS and it all worked out pretty well. Positive experience, top marks, tally ho.
