**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
Prior to today I had been struggling with the GitHub push/clone/merge functions, but I spent two hours reading up on them this afternoon. When we began the GPS I felt like I had a slightly better overall understanding, but was still shaky on applying the concepts.


**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
I got the chance to put the concepts into practice, which helped a good deal.  It wasn't particularly enjoyable to do it in a supervised/graded environment, but obviously that's no one's fault but my own for not practing beforehand.  I feel like now I have a better overview of the whole process, but will need to practice quite a bit more in the next few weeks to get really comfortable with the GitHub workflow.


**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
My pair and I confirmed with the guide that creating a new branch on a feature branch would open a branch twice removed from the master, and she helped us with the syntax for `git commit --amend -m "message"`.  There were a few other questions as well, but it's a bit of a blur at this point.
I asked my pair about what he was doing when he was driving, and the required questions from the Releases.  We also asked each other about parts that we were unsure about, such as clarifying the `git fetch` command, and we talked through a moment when we were lost on GitHub (we pushed the local file up to GH but forgot that we had to open a pull request as well).


**What still confuses you about Git?**
Fetching and merging repos.  I haven't found a good mental model yet for Git, so it's hard for me to process/add new information because I don't have "places" in my mind for the info to live.  The multiple masters, multiple branches, forked repos, local versus remote, etc. is all packed into one box in my head and it's difficult to make sense of how all the pieces fit together.  But I'm working on it.  Oh, and commit messages.  I understand the principles behind good commit messages, but it'd be nice to see a number of samples demonstrating good- and poor-practices.


**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
Fine, I guess.  Overall I think I prefer the paired sessions that I've had, there was much less pressure, I felt more free to experiment, and I was more comfortable with the subject matter.
